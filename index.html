                <p>
                    The debates around renewable sources of energy have been going on at least a decade.<br>
                     After more than a century of relying on fossil fuels almost entirely, changing this<br>
                      paradigm in favor of the renewable energy sources may seem difficult and unjustified<br>
                       for some people. However, the situation when fossil fuel was the most efficient and<br>
                        the cheapest source of energy has been left far in the past; nowadays, it is obvious<br>
                         that using oil or gas is not just expensive, but also causes tremendous damage to the<br>
                          planet we live on. Many countries such as Germany or Sweden have already made significant<br>
                           efforts to fix this situation, employing numerous power plants working on the renewable<br>
                            sources of energy; the most effective among these sources is geothermal energy. Using<br>
                             it has a number of benefits which should be considered by the governments globally.
